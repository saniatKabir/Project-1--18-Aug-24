	<h2>Task-1: Linking Pages</h2>
	<h3>External Link</h3>
	<p>Linking a external page from the web can be done by adding hyperlink of that perticular page. For example: we can go to the page of ssb641 by clicking on
		<b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/fullstackwebdevelopmentonline64" target="_blank">Facebook</a></b>. Presently, if anyone clicks on the word "Facebook" it will open in a new tab since target is set to "_blank". If "_blank" was not set as target, it would open on the same tab. It is to be noted that if the hyperlink is not available insert # in the hyperlink value</p>
	<h3>Internal Link</h3>
	<p> In case of internal link, there are mainly two kinds of link namely forward link and backward link.</p>
	<h4>Forward Link</h4>
	<p>During Forword Link, there may be mainly three situations: index.htlm file and the file or any object to be linked may be in the same directory, root directory, or in different directory like sub-folder or sub-sub.... folder. When other folders are linked in index.html file or the 'HOME' page, normally those are linked following forword link procedure.<br><br>
	<b><u>In same directory:</u></b> If the index.htlm file is on the same directory it can be linked by inserting the name in the valu of
	hyperlink:</p>
	
	<a href="index.html">HOME</a> |
	
	<a href="hw.html" target="_blank">PAGE-1</a>

	<p><u><b>If the files are in deffent directory:</b></u> In this case the file will be linked with the forward slash following forward linking method. In this case use "folder name/filename.html" to be linked. For example:</p>

	<a href="index.html">HOME</a> |
	
	<a href="hw.html" target="_blank">PAGE-1</a>

	<a href="pages/hw2.html">PAGE-2</a>

	<a href="pages/ssb/intro.html">PAGE-3</a>

	<h4>Backward Link</h4>
	<p>For back ward link you manytime do you need to go back from present file location. One must use that number of "../" before adding the folder name/file name</p>
